# Scrapy-ProductDetails
Using Python Scrapy Package I have analysed data from a website and made a dataset of scraped data in two formats json and csv.

## Supported Python versions
Scrapy requires Python 3.6+, either the CPython implementation (default) or the PyPy 7.2.0+ implementation (see Alternate Implementations).

## Installing Scrapy
If you’re already familiar with installation of Python packages, you can install Scrapy and its dependencies from PyPI with:

```bash
  pip install Scrapy
```

If you’re using Anaconda or Miniconda, you can install the package from the conda-forge channel, which has up-to-date packages for Linux, Windows and macOS.
To install Scrapy using conda, run:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge scrapy
```
strongly recommend that you install Scrapy in a [dedicated virtualenv](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html#intro-using-virtualenv), to avoid conflicting with your system packages.

Note that sometimes this may require solving compilation issues for some Scrapy dependencies depending on your operating system, so be sure to check the [Platform specific installation notes](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html#intro-install-platform-notes).
